# Data Visualisation based on Conceptual Modelling


## Description

This project is to develop a full-stack web application that has implemented front-end and back-end separation technologies. In terms of language and framework choices, our project seamlessly combines the robust back-end capabilities of Spring Boot with the dynamic front-end framework of Vue.js. This fusion results in a resilient and effective platform that caters to a broad spectrum of web development requirements.



## Core functionality

**1)** Extract metadata from a relational database and generate a physical entity relationship model of the data (in the form of relational diagram with foreign key links).
**2)** Perform pattern matching between entity-relationship model and the set of visualisation schema patterns.
**3)** Recommend potential visualisation types based on the user-selected entity, schema pattern and attributes. 
**4)** Assist the users in filtering, sorting, setting number limit and modifying identified key for data.
**5)** Generate a variety of visualisations using data retrieved from database.
